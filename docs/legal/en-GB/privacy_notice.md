# Intlayer Privacy Notice

## Introduction

At Intlayer, we take privacy seriously. This notice explains how we handle information collected through our website and CMS.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about privacy, please contact us at the following address: [contact@intlayer.org](mailto:contact@intlayer.org).

## Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use **Google Analytics** and the **Meta (Facebook) Pixel** to analyse the use of our website and improve our services. These tools generate statistics and other information about the website using cookies stored on users' devices.

For more information:

- [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Metaâ€™s privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy)

## Authentication and User Data

Access to the Intlayer CMS requires user authentication. We offer both email/password authentication and third-party sign-in via **Google** and **GitHub**.

During the authentication process, we collect:

- Email address
- Display name (or chosen name)

Users may also access the CMS via access tokens linked to their account. These tokens are tied to the same authentication data.

## Data Storage and Security

User authentication data is stored in a **MongoDB database** hosted on **cloud.mongodb.com**:

- **Region:** AWS / Oregon (us-west-2)
- **Type:** Replica Set (3 nodes)
- **Password Security:** All passwords are hashed using industry-standard practices.

We do not store any unnecessary personal data beyond what is required for authentication and secure CMS access.

## Data Sharing with Third Parties

We do **not** sell or share your personal data with third parties, except as required for analytics (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel) or as part of the authentication process (Google or GitHub sign-in).

## Users' Rights

As a user, you have the right to:

- Access the personal data we hold about you
- Request correction or deletion of your data
- Revoke access or delete your account

For any request regarding your data, contact us at [contact@intlayer.org](mailto:contact@intlayer.org).

## Changes to This Notice

We may update this privacy notice from time to time. Users are advised to regularly check this page to stay informed of any changes.
