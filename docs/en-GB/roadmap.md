# Intlayer: Feature Overview & Roadmap

Intlayer is a content management and internationalization solution designed to streamline how you declare, manage, and update content across your applications. It offers powerful features such as centralized or distributed content declaration, extensive internationalization options, Markdown support, conditional rendering, TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON integration, and more. Below is a comprehensive overview of what Intlayer currently provides, followed by upcoming roadmap features.

---

## Current Features

### 1. Content Declaration

#### Centralized or Distributed

- **Centralized**: Declare all your content in a single, large file at the base of your application, similar to i18next, so you can manage everything in one place.
- **Distributed**: Alternatively, split your content into separate files at the component or feature level for better maintainability. This keeps your content close to the relevant code (components, tests, Storybook, etc.). Removing a component ensures any associated content is also removed, preventing leftover data from cluttering your codebase.

### 2. Internationalization

- Support for **230 languages and locales** (including regional variants like French (France), English (Canada), English (UK), Portuguese (Portugal), etc.).
- Easily manage translations for all these locales from one place.

### 3. Markdown Support

- Declare content using **Markdown**, allowing you to automatically format text with paragraphs, headings, links, and more.
- Ideal for blog posts, articles, documentation pages, or any scenario where rich text formatting is needed.

### 4. Conditional Rendering

- Define content that adapts based on specific conditions, such as user language, user login status, or any other context-related variable.
- Helps tailor personalized experiences without duplicating content across multiple files.

### 5. Content Declaration Formats

Intlayer supports **TypeScript** (also JavaScript) and **JSON** for declaring content.

- **TypeScript**:

  - Ensures your content structure is correct and that no translations are missing.
  - Offers strict or more flexible validation modes.
  - Allows dynamic data fetching from variables, functions, or external APIs.

- **JSON**:

  - Makes it easy to integrate with external tools (like visual editors) due to its standardized format.

## Integration with Frameworks & Environments

### 1. Next.js

#### a. Server and Client Components

- Provides a **unified content management approach** for both server and client components.
- Offers a built-in context for server components, simplifying implementation compared to other solutions.

#### b. Metadata, Sitemaps, and robots.txt

- Fetch and inject content dynamically to generate metadata, sitemaps, or `robots.txt` files.

#### c. Middleware

- Add a middleware to **redirect users** to content based on their preferred language.

#### d. Turbopack and Webpack Compatibility

- Fully compatible with the new Next.js Turbopack as well as traditional Webpack.

# Roadmap: Upcoming Features

### 1. A/B Testing & Personalization

- **Multivariate Testing**: Test different versions of a given piece of content to see which performs best (e.g., higher click rate).
- **Data-Driven Personalization**: Display different content based on user demographics (gender, age, location, etc.), or other behavior patterns.
- **Automated Iteration**: Allow AI to automatically test multiple versions and either pick the top performer or recommend options for admin approval.

### 2. Versioning

- Restore previous versions of your content with **content versioning**.
- Track changes over time and revert to earlier states if needed.

### 3. Automatic Translation

- For remote CMS users, **one-click translation generation** for any supported language.
- The system would generate translations in the background and then prompt you for validation or edits.

### 4. SEO Enhancements

- Tools to **analyze keywords**, user search intent, and emerging trends.
- Suggest improved content for better rankings, and track long-term performance.

### 5. Compatibility with More Frameworks

- Efforts are underway to support **Vue, Solid, Svelte, Angular**, and more.
- Aim to make Intlayer compatible with **any JavaScript-powered application**.

### 6. IDE Extensions

- Extensions for major IDEs to provide a **graphical interface** for managing local and remote translations.
- Features could include auto-generating content declaration files for components, direct integration with the Intlayer CMS, and real-time validation.
